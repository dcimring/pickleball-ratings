## 🟢 Option 1: The "Top Left" Utility Brand (SELECTED)
**Refined & Professional**

- **Placement**: Sticky navigation element in the top-left corner.
- **Style**: Small, ultra-wide tracking using the Orbitron font.
- **Aesthetic**: `DINKDATA<span class="text-volt">.XYZ</span>`
- **Vibe**: Clean, SaaS-style dashboard. Functional and constant without distracting from the main hero title.

## 🟡 Option 2: The "Vertical Sidewall"
**Bold & Modern**

- **Placement**: Rotated 90° and pinned to the right edge of the viewport.
- **Style**: Large, bold display font with low opacity (ghosted effect).
- **Aesthetic**: `dinkdata.xyz` as a structural watermark.
- **Vibe**: High-end architectural design. Makes the site feel like a custom-engineered data application.

## 🔴 Option 3: The "Badge" Overhang
**Premium & Official**

- **Placement**: Tucked just above the "P" in "PICKLEBALL", slightly overlapping the main heading.
- **Style**: High-contrast Volt-colored pill badge with black text.
- **Aesthetic**: Small, punchy tag: `[ DINKDATA.XYZ ]`
